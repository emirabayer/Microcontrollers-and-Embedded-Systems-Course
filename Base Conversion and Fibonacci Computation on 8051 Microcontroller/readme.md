This lab involves programming an 8051 microcontroller to perform base conversions and Fibonacci sequence calculations using the Proteus simulator. The first part implements a decimal-to-binary, base-4, and base-8 converter, displaying results on an LCD. <\br>

The second part calculates the nth Fibonacci number (0 ≤ n ≤ 24) recursively without lookup tables, handling multi-register storage for larger values. The project demonstrates proficiency in embedded systems programming, microcontroller arithmetic, and LCD interfacing, reinforcing low-level programming and register management skills.
