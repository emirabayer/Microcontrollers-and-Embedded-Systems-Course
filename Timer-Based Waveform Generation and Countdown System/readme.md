This lab focuses on using 8051 microcontroller timers. In Part 1, students generate two square waveforms with specific frequencies and duty cycles based on a switch configuration, displaying results on a Proteus oscilloscope. In Part 2, a countdown system is implemented, taking input from a keypad and displaying the countdown on an LCD, updating every 0.5 seconds. Both parts emphasize precision and correct use of timers.
