This lab focuses on generating square waveforms using microcontroller timers. In Part 1, a primary waveform is produced with a specified duty cycle and frequency, while a secondary waveform maintains half the duty cycle. In Part 2, the system dynamically alternates duty cycles at fixed intervals, displaying frequency and duty cycle values on an LCD. The experiment reinforces precise timer usage, waveform control, and real-time display integration. A below 1% error rate was achieved without using interrupts.
