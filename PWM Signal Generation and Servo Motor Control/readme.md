This lab involves generating PWM signals using FRDM-KL25 timers to control an SG90 servo motor. Students will create PWM signals with specific duty cycles and frequencies, verified using an oscilloscope. The servo motor will rotate in a predefined pattern (0째 to 90째 and back), and an interrupt service routine (ISR) will toggle the pattern (180째 to 90째 and back) when a button is pressed. Timers and GPIO configurations are used for PWM generation and motor control.
