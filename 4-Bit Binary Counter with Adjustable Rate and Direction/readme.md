This lab involves implementing a 4-bit binary counter using switches to control counting rate and direction. Switches adjust the counting rate (0ms, 250ms, 500ms, 1000ms) and toggle between increasing and decreasing order. LEDs represent the 4-bit counter. Students must ensure real-time switch configuration changes without resetting the counter, using a custom delay function instead of timers. Partial credit is available for incomplete implementations.
