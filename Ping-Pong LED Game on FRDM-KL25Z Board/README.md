This lab involves implementing a ping-pong style LED game on the FRDM-KL25Z board, controlling five LEDs with three buttons to create dynamic lighting effects. The project includes a single-ball mode with a bouncing LED pattern, speed toggling, direction reversal, and a two-ball mode with adjacent LED pairs, all managed through GPIO configurations without timers. The implementation showcases knowledge in embedded systems programming, real-time input handling, and state management, demonstrating an understanding of hardware interfacing and efficient code design.
